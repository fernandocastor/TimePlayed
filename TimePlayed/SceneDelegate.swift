    //========================================================================
    // To make this work without the Main storyboard, had to erase references
    // to it from both info.plist (Storyboard Name) and the general project
    // configurations, under Deployment Info (Main Interface). In addition,
    // must use an empty storyboard because, otherwise, the borders of the
    // screen will be all messed up. The app will only use a small part of
    // the screen. Is it because if we explicitly create a launch screen,
    // it will treat the view of the root view controller as the launch
    // screen?
